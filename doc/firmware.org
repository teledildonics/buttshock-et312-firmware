* ET-312 Firmware Reverse Engineering
** Introduction
This document contains notes about the reverse engineering efforts
against the firmware of the [[http://shop.erostek.com/products/ET312B-Power-Unit.html][ET-312B Electrostimulation Device]],
including what is currently known about the firmware, and different
attack vectors. The goal is to provide an unencrypted version of the
ET-312B firmware that can be modified and upgraded.

This will hopefully be updated as progress continues, mainly so I
don't have to repeat myself over IRC/Twitter/Telegram/Etc.

There's also a good chance we're missing something obvious, so if you
see something here we've missed, please [[https://github.com/metafetish/erosoutsider/issues][file a github issue and let us
know!]]

** tl;dr Problem Summary

For those that are just curious what we're up to and what we're
running into:

We want an unencrypted version of the firmware for the ET-312B, which
has an ATMega16 in it.

We have:

- An ET-312B Box
- 2 Firmware upgrade files for the box, [[https://github.com/metafetish/erosoutsider/tree/master/firmware][available here]]

These files are somehow obfuscated or encrypted, and the bootloader on
the ATMega16 undoes that encryption when we upload the firmware to the
chip. Due to fuses being set on the chip, we can't access the flash or
bootloader through JTAG or other hardware debugging methods. Due to
the chip being a harvard architecture, we can't screw with the stack
and inject instructions 'cause we don't have access to code space.
While we know that the flash will contain AVR assembly, strings, etc,
we aren't sure what order the upgrade file is in, or where those
things might be in it.

** What We Know Currently
*** System Specifics
The ET-312B runs on an ATMega16A chip. There is no external
RAM/EEPROM/etc, everything exists in memory on the chip.

All fuses are set on the chip, locking out JTAG access or the ability
to read out the flash or bootloader.
*** Firmware Upgrade Files
**** Files
Two versions of the firmware, for v1.5 and v1.6, are available via the
firmware upgrade website:

[[http://blog.erostek.com/2012/08/27/et-312-firmware-upgrade-1/][http://blog.erostek.com/2012/08/27/et-312-firmware-upgrade-1/]]

These files (312-15.upg and 312-16.upg), are also available in the
[[http://github.com/metafetish/erosoutsider/][Erosoutsider Repo]].

**** Analysis and Assumptions
Some assumptions about the upgrade files:

- Neither file is a plaintext flash image. They've been at least
  obfuscated, if not fully encrypted, and possibly rearranged. Since
  we don't have access to the bootloader code, there's no telling what
  they could be. We just know that somewhere in here is the code to
  run the ET312.
- Both firmware files are 15872 bytes, which is 16384 - 512. Since the
  bootloader takes up 512 bytes of the Flash, there's a good chance
  the upgrade files could just be images of the rest of the flash.
- It is assumed that these files are encrypted via some sort of stream
  cipher, mainly due to the patterns that emerge when comparing them
  (see below). The serial protocol used a simple XOR cipher [[../doc/et312-protocol.org][(more
  information on this is available in the serial protocol
  documentation)]], so there's a chance this could be similarly simple.

*** Upload/Upgrade Process
To upgrade the firmware on the box, the upgrade file is simply
transferred via the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM][XMODEM protocol]]. Full instructions for upgrading
are listed in the Reference section of this document.
** Methods
*** JTAG/Stack Smashing/Etc to Get At Flash
**** Basic Idea
Use either hardware debuggers or screwing with the stack in RAM to get
at the flash
**** Activity/Progress
No luck here.

JTAG or hardware debugging in general is dead from the start despite
there being a JTAG header on the board, due to the fuses being set.

Screwing with the stack doesn't do use much good because this is a
harvard architecture chip, so we can't really inject instructions in a
useful manner since all of the code sits in another address space
anyways. The best we might be able to do is play with return addresses
to figure out where things are in flash and try to match that to the
upgrade file in order to produce plaintext.

*** Serial Protocol Work
**** Basic Idea
The basics of the Serial Protocol is already reverse engineered. It
provides a peek/poke interface on top of a weird virtual memory like
system, able to access parts of the ROM, RAM, and EEPROM.

More information on the serial protocol is available at

https://github.com/metafetish/erosoutsider/wiki/Serial-Protocol

**** Activity
This is probably the best vector for retrieving the firmware. The RAM
address space contains all of the processor registers, IO registers,
and the stack. All of those areas are writable, giving us a lot of
freedom in what we can do.

***** Mode String Glitching Method 

For instance, using the [[https://github.com/metafetish/erosoutsider-py][erosoutsider-py]] library, we can run the
following code (eo refers to an ErosOutsider object):

#+BEGIN_SRC python
e = ErosOutsiderSerial("/dev/ttyUSB0")
e.perform_handshake()
eo.write_sync(0x4014, 0x09)
eo.write_sync(0x4015, 0x04)
eo.write_sync(0x4016, 0x03)
eo.write_sync(0x4017, 0x24)
#+END_SRC

This block overwrites r14-r17, causing the box to error and display a
"Shut Down Power!!" message on the LCD screen. If we then hit the "Up"
button, we are taken to the mode menu, but the string offset is wrong,
so instead of showing the mode name, we get random parts of other
strings.

Assuming the "Up" button is pressed enough times, we start getting
gibberish on the LCD screen, meaning we've jumped over the string
boundaries and are in program space.

The CPU is most likely talking I2C or SPI to the LCD controller board,
so assuming we can come up with a script that can glitch this
correctly and play with the string offset, we could use a logic
analyzer to dump the firmware via the LCD, and reassemble it on the
host machine.

***** Other Interesting Stuff
Interesting facts from playing with memory using the protocol:

- Reading from the EEPROM, there's strings stored in 8 byte chunks,
  with spaces around them to buffer up to 8 characters if they aren't
  already, and no null terminators. This may be a common way to
  storing strings in the system, as for instance the pattern mode
  names are all <=8 characters.

*** File Comparison/Analysis
**** Basic Idea
Armed with a spec sheet, knowledge of AVR assembly and binary tools,
pick at the upgrade files until either something makes sense or the
heat death of the universe consumes us all.
**** Activity/Progress
While entropy tests run against the files using the [[https://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php][Dieharder Test
Suite]] show that the files themselves are fairly random, comparing the
files to each other shows some patterns. For instance, here is the
first 256 bytes of each file:

#+END_EXAMPLE

It's doubtful that the actual firmware is 100% valid data, so there's
a good chance that whatever utility was used to build the upgrade file
might just be filling it with randomness.

There's also assumptions that could be made about the order of the
firmware. For instance, usually the AVR IVT is at the top of the flash
address space, so there's a chance that the matching portions of the
first sections of the 2 files are the IVTs, which probably don't
change much. However, this idea hasn't gotten very far in practice.
*** Brute Force Writing
**** Basic Idea
More a mapping technique than an attack, but by changing every Nth
byte by a known value, we may be able to map parts of the upgrade file
as we see strings change in the UI on the box.

For instance, we can increase every 10th byte in a block of the
firmware by a value of 1. Assuming the firmware runs, we can watch for
misspelled/changed strings around the box UI.

This is still perilous at best. Flash only has a certain number of
guaranteed writes (yes it's in the 1000s but let's assume we're really
bad at this and also the fact that...), and we've only got 1 box, so
if that chip gets ruined before we figure this out, we have a problem
(and no warranty).

**** Activity/Progress
The last 13 bytes of the firmware can be set to any value, and the box
will still boot. Changing any other values will cause the box to boot
directly into firmware upgrade mode, meaning there's probably a CRC
check in the bootloader that's checking the integrity of the bits and
not jumping if it finds an error. 

Complete guess, but it's probably a CRC-16 that's the last 2 bytes.
However, if those bytes are also encrypted, we're out of luck for
changing much.

*** LED Signals during Firmware Upload
**** Basic Idea
From step 12 of the "Upgrade Instructions" in the References section:

12. Click Send and the file transfer should begin. The Ch A and Ch B
    lights will flash randomly as the data is transferred to the
    ET-312. DO NOT interrupt this process in any way.

Nothing ever happens randomly.
**** Activity/Progress
Mapped LED A to be controlled by Pin 20 of the ATMega16, attached to a
logic analyzer. During firmware upload, there's a signal that happens
on this pin between packet upload and ACK response in the XMODEM
protocol. The signal is repeatable between uploads. Further analysis
required, but doubtful this is going anywhere.

*** RF/Power Sidechannel channel/Glitching
**** Basic Idea
The fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuture! While now feasible with projects like
ChipWhisperer, not sure if it's all that applicable here.

That said, if we could write one XMODEM packet then possibly see
what's happening in the chip that way? Sure. But it's magic to us at
the moment.
**** Activity/Progress
No real direction with this, require advice of grown up and/or magic
person.

*** Chip Uncapping
**** Basic Idea
Ship the chip and $800 or so somewhere and have them pop the top off
and do magic to it.
**** Activity/Progress
What fun is that? :(
*** Just Ask The Manufacturer to Open Source The Firmware
**** Basic Idea
Put on a nice outfit. Knock politely on the front door.
**** Activity/Progress
What fun is that? :(

3. Go to the Start, Programs, Accessories, menu in Windows and find
   Hyperterminal. It may be under Communications depending on which
   version of windows you have.
4. When Hyperterminal starts, wait for the welcome screen to go away
   and then enter any name in the New Connection box such as "ET312"
   and click OK.
5. In the Connect To box, select the serial port used in Step 1 from
   the Connect Using pull down menu. This will usually be COM1 - COM4.
   Then click OK.
6. In the Properties box, select the following options: Bits per
   second=19200, Data bits=8, Parity=None, Stop bits=1, Flow
   control=None and click OK.
7. Hold down the Menu and Up buttons on the ET-312 at the same time,
   then turn on the ET-312 while keeping them held down. The display
   should be blank and the Ch A and Ch B LEDs should blink slowly. If
   the ET-312 powers up normally, you did not hold down the buttons
   correctly as try again.
8. In Hyperterminal you should see a string of "C" characters appear
   at about 1 per second. If you don't see anything or you see
   different characters, Hyperterminal is not configured correctly or
   there is a problem with the serial port. Shut down Hyperterminal
   and try again selecting other available COM ports and make sure the
   properties in Step 6 are correct.
9. When you see the string of "C" characters in Hyperterminal, select
   the Transfer menu and Send file. If you wait too long, you'll have
   to power the ET-312 off and try again (the LEDs will stop
   blinking).
10. In the Send File box, make sure you select Xmodem as the protocol
    (NOT Zmodem or 1k Xmodem).
11. After Xmodem is selected, enter or Browse to the filename of the
    new firmware. For example, the version 1.6 upgrade file is called
    "312-16.upg".
12. Click Send and the file transfer should begin. The Ch A and Ch B
    lights will flash randomly as the data is transferred to the
    ET-312. DO NOT interrupt this process in any way.
13. When the transfer is completed, the ET-312 will power up normally
    and the display should show the new version of the software. If
    anything goes wrong, try again starting over from Step 1. If you
    still can't make it work, contact ErosTek or SexTek for further
    assistance.
14. Once the transfer is complete, you can turn the ET-312 off, unplug
    the cable, and close Hyperterminal (you do not need to save the
    Hyperterminal session).
